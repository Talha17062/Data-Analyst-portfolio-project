This repository is for those who are interested in making data analyst portfolio. If you want to become a data analyst then you must have sound understanding of RDBMS and BI tools in short.
Talking about this repository, this portfolio was made just for the practice purpose and all the pertinent data to start this journey was taken from Microsoft officail website. It includes, data cleansing, data transforming and data retrieving steps using  Microsoft SQL Server 19. For report building and visualisation, I used the Power BI because of its affordability, Natural Query Language and custom visualisation. Three reports have been prepared in this project which will give you the interactive overview of Sales, Customer and Product information.
